### Introduction

This is a simple implementation of Back Propagation Algorithm using C++.

So far, this algorithm supports any number of Fully Connected Layer, as well as two kinds of activation function
(Sigmoid and ReLU). The loss function is set to be TSELoss (Total Square Error).

### Build and Run
Make sure you have `cmake` in your system.

```sh
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make
./main
```
